Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research Network
======
* National Science Foundation
* Spring 2021 to present
* Research goal: Quantitatively predict biomass production in response to climate-related stressors to gauge real-time and project future broad-scale wetland health and resilience.
  * Collected and published vegetation productivity measurements across annual and seasonal cycles in macrotidal S. alterniflora-dominated marshes on Sapelo Island and Coastal Georgia.
  * Wrote laboratory protocols and trained technicians in biomass sample processing.
  * Developed and published open-source R code for efficient data processing and analysis, and optimized machine learning models for remote sensing-based biomass predictions.
