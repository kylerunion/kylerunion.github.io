The beneficial use of dredged material (BUDM) for wetland restoration improves coastal wetland resilience and conserves coastal natural infrastructure. Tools, such as biophysical models help coastal managers to assess habitat vulnerability and plan restoration. In this study, the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM) will be utilized combined with observed data to predict future conditions and evaluate potential marsh restoration via the BUDM in Mobile Bay, Alabama. A range of site conditions and restoration strategies will be considered and the impacts on dredged material management area (DMMA) volumes will be evaluated. Wetland restoration via thin-layer placement (TLP) of dredged material (DM) restores marsh elevation to combat sea level rise (SLR) and conserves fill capacity in DMMAs. A simplified mapping approach to assess this type of restoration will be demonstrated using wetland area and DM sources to determine the coastal United States wetland area to which it could be further applied. The mapping exercise revealed that 6,240 km2 of US wetlands were suitable for restoration and sediment resources exist to conduct this type of restoration from navigational dredging. The further development of a spatial application of the MEM is needed to provide an operational tool for managers and refine these restoration estimates.
