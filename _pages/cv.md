Education
======
* Ph.D in Marine Science, University of Texas at Austin, 2025 (expected)
* M.S. in Marine Science, University of Delaware, 2019
* B.S. in Environmental Science, University of Maryland, 2015

Research Experience
======
* Mission Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, NOAA
  * <ins>Research goal</ins>: Assess and compare region- and species-specific and -invariant salt marsh plant growth patterns for application in modeling products and applied management.
    *  Investigated productivity metrics in microtidal Spartina alterniflora and Distichlis spicata dominated marshes in the Texas Coastal Bend and applied to advance modeling products.
    *  Developed engaging science outreach materials and presented to ~150 students.
* Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research Network
  * <ins>Research goal</ins>: Quantitatively predict biomass production in response to climate-related stressors to gauge real-time and project future broad-scale wetland health and resilience.
    *  Collected and published vegetation productivity measurements across annual and seasonal cycles in macrotidal S. alterniflora-dominated marshes on Sapelo Island and Coastal Georgia.
    *  Wrote laboratory protocols and trained technicians in biomass sample processing.
    *  Developed and published open-source R code for efficient data processing and analysis, and optimized machine learning models for remote sensing-based biomass predictions.
* Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
  * <ins>Research goal</ins>:Evaluate feasibility of wetland restoration via the beneficial use of dredged material to resolve sediment resource issues and improve coastal resilience.
    *  Developed framework for coastal managers to apply the Marsh Equilibrium Model in concert with thin-layer placement scenarios to evaluate optimal local wetland restoration techniques.
    *  Assessed geochronology and sediment deposition patterns via gamma-ray spectroscopy of sediment cores to understand long-term elevation change in coastal systems.
    *  Characterized estuary wave regime using conceptual surface water and wave models through high-performance computing systems (SMS, STWAVE) to determine sediment transport potential.
* Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
  * <ins>Research goal</ins>: Characterize restoration outcome of large scale thin-layer placement project through assessment of sediment transport within tidal wetland system.
    *  Monitored suspended sediment concentrations and flow characteristics to generate conceptual model of transport in and out of the refuge wetland complex.
    *  Conducted sediment fingerprinting analyses via gamma spectroscopy to pinpoint spatial and temporal transport characteristics.
* Chesapeake Bay Program, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
  * <ins>Research goal</ins>: Facilitate projects to protect, restore, and enhance fish and wildlife habitats across the Chesapeake Bay watershed by coordinating partnership efforts.
    *  Tracked wetland creation, restoration, enhancement, and protection throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed to advance the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement.
    *  Facilitated a Wetland Expert Panel report for the incorporation of non-tidal wetland best management practices and land uses in the Phase 6 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model.
    *  Organized efforts to sustain and enhance the design of aerial and ground surveys of Chesapeake Bay submerged aquatic vegetation through workshops and written reports.
