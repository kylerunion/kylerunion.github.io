Welcome to my website!

I am a landscape ecologist focusing on studying productivity patterns. Most of my research lies in coastal wetlands, and uses remote sensing and geospatial analyses to investigate change against stressors ike sea-level rise.

I am currently working on my Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin's Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas, TX. I plan to graduate in Spring 2025 and am **actively searching for postdoc or analyst roles** to carry on my research. Reach out to me at kylerunion@gmail.com.

Previously, I was a research fellow stationed at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center in Vicksburg, MS. Here I studied wetland restoration techniques.

I earned my M.S. in Marine Science from the University of Delaware in Lewes, DE in Fall 2019. There, I studied sediment transport in a recently restored tidal weland complex in Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge in Delaware.

I got my start in the environmental realm with the Chesapeake Research Consortium and Chesapeake Bay Program in Annapolis, MD, where from 2015 to 2017 I facilitated restoration and conservation planning across the U.S.'s largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay.

My B.S. was completed at the University of Maryland in Environmental Science in 2015. Go Terps!
